## Getting Started

Nounbricks is a component library built to make it easy for you to add noun assets to your Javascript projects.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Nounbricks is currently under development and is not yet ready for production use.

### Installing NounBricks

#### With build tools

Install the nounbricks npm package

```sh
npm install @nounbricks/nounbricks-vue
```

Import and use the components from `@nounbricks/nounbricks-vue` üéâ

```vue
<template>
  <FullNoun
    body="bege-crt"
    head="head-ape"
    accessories="bird-side"
    glasses="glasses-square-black-rgb"
  ></FullNoun>
</template>

<script setup>
import { FullNoun } from "@nounbricks/nounbricks-vue";
</script>
```

#### Without build tools

You can try out nounbricks components directly on the browser.

```html
<div id="app"></div>

<!-- load vue before loading nounbricks -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
<!-- import nounbricks from unpkg -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nounbricks/nounbricks-vue"></script>
<script>
  const { FullNoun } = nounbricks;
  const { createApp } = Vue;
  const app = createApp({
    components: {
      FullNoun,
    },
    template: `<FullNoun
        body="bege-crt"
        head="head-bag"
        accessories="bird-side"
        glasses="glasses-square-black-rgb"

        bg-color="d5d7e1"
      ></FullNoun>`,
  });

  app.mount("#app");
</script>
```

## Component Options

> You can find more examples for the component options in respective component sections.

### Render a noun with background

All the components ( `FullNoun`, `NounHead`, `NounGlasses`, `NounBody`, `NounAccessory` have a prop `bg-color` ) which lets you specify any background color ( as hex code ) for your rendered noun/noun trait.

```vue
<fullnoun ... bg-color="d5d7e1" />
```

### Render a noun without a background

you can omit the `bg-color` prop to render a noun/noun trait without any backgroud.

### Fit to bounds

normally nouns are rendered within a 320x320 square. mostly this leaves additional space which we might want to get rid of. in that situation you can use a `fit-to-bounds` prop and it should remove all the additional space.

```vue
<fullnoun ... fit-to-bounds />
```

### Render as an IMG or SVG

you might want to render the noun as an img instead of a full svg. this helps performance when rendering a lot of nouns together. in those scenarios you can use the `renderType` prop.

the default value for renderType is `svg`

```vue-html
<fullnoun
    ...
    renderType="img"
/>
```
